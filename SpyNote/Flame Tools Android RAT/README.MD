* A RAT, or Remote Access Trojan, is a type of malicious software designed to allow unauthorized remote access to a computer system. Once a system is infected with a RAT, the attacker gains the ability to control the targeted device as if they had physical access. Clandestine access grants the attacker remote control, surveillance (screenshots, keystroke recording), and theft of sensitive data (login credentials, personal information)

* In the world of cyber threats, Flame RAT is a potent, undetectable Android remote administration tool developed for Android systems. Its sale was initially identified on a dark web site.  Although the software is sold on the dark web, there is also a website where it is sold on the normal web.
